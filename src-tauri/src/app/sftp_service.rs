//! SFTP file-transfer service.
//!
//! Design goals (cross-platform, zero extra dependencies):
//! - Only the system OpenSSH toolchain is used (`ssh` + `sftp`). No sshpass,
//!   no russh/ssh2 crates, so the app still builds and ships on Windows.
//! - On Unix every remote operation is multiplexed over a pooled SSH
//!   ControlMaster, so navigating directories costs one round trip instead of a
//!   full SSH handshake. Password auth feeds the prompt through a pty (the same
//!   proven path as `connection.rs::test_ssh_password`).
//! - Win32-OpenSSH has no ControlMaster support (there is no Unix domain
//!   socket multiplexing), and `sftp -b` implies `BatchMode=yes`, which makes
//!   password authentication impossible. Windows therefore drives a *pooled
//!   interactive* `sftp` session over a pty: the password prompt is answered
//!   once, then commands are typed and synchronised on the `sftp>` prompt.
//!   The same path is the fallback whenever a ControlMaster cannot be built.
//! - Directory listings are produced by the *local* sftp client
//!   (`ls -lan`, numeric view) instead of the server supplied `longname`,
//!   which makes the column layout identical for Linux, BSD, Solaris,
//!   AIX and Windows OpenSSH servers.
//! - Transfers run inside a pty so OpenSSH prints its progress meter, which we
//!   parse and forward to the UI.
